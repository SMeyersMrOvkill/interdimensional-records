## Pastel Form: A Species Description

**Pastel Form** (Latin: *Forma Pastellicus*) is a fictional species of extraterrestrial origin found on a volcanic planet orbiting a neutron star. This species is highly unusual because it does not rely on water, but rather liquid metals like iron and copper, for its biological functions.

**Physical Characteristics:** Pastel Forms lack flesh and bone as found in terrestrial creatures. Instead, their bodies are composed of dense metals, adapted to the liquid metal oceans of their home planet. These bodies are resistant to extremely high temperatures and the intense radiation emitted by the nearby neutron star.

**Communication:** Remarkably, Pastel Forms communicate through electromagnetic waves. This method is incredibly fast, but also vulnerable, as external radiation can sometimes interfere with their thoughts.

**Diseases:** "Harmonious Frequency Disorder" is a serious condition that can afflict these creatures. It is caused by an overabundance of similarly-tuned frequency receptors in their systems, leading to disrupted neural activity.

**Culture:**  Little is known about the culture of the Pastel Forms. However, their capacity for rapid thought and adaptation to an extreme environment suggests an intelligent and resilient species.
